# DatabaseOperations-TestApp

This is a test app that will use the library available as a NuGet package

It currently contains four classes that show the different ways to perform the backup task.

To test the library using this test app, ensure you use the latest NuGet package or the package built locally, and change the connection strings to point to a database that actually exists.
